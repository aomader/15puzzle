# 15 Puzzle

![15 Puzzle](http://reaktor42.de/~b52/public/15puzzle.png)

To test the capabilities of F# in terms of creating WPF application I thought it might be the best to actually create WPF application and see how it performs.
It's a simple application to solve the [15 puzzle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle). The idea was to use the same methodology as one would doing the same using C#. Meaning stuff like MVVM, Commands, Converters, etc.
